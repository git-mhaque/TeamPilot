# TeamPilot
`TeamPilot` transforms raw Jira data into actionable intelligence. By orchestrating automated workflows through the lens of three expert AI personas — `The Scrum Master`, `The Agile Coach`, and `The Delivery Manager` — it provides the navigation and insights teams need to land their sprints on time, every time.

|Persona |	TeamPilot Role	| Focus Area |
|---|--|---|
| Scrum Master	| The Navigator |	Tactical sprint execution and obstacle removal.| 
| Agile Coach	| The Flight Instructor	| Long-term growth, health metrics, and cultural evolution. | 
| Delivery Manager |	The Mission Director |	Strategic alignment across multiple initiatives and timelines. |


This project orchestrates and automates team workflows and generates insights via Cline workflows. These workflows use Jira as a primary data source and leverage Python to fetch and preprocess relevant data, and then utilize AI to generate insightful artifacts.
